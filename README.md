## ✨ New! Integrated Citation Manager <a name="citation-manager"></a>
* All-in-one Citation Workflow: Manage every reference without leaving your document—search, create, edit, and insert citations in the same sidebar.
* Smart Source Search: Look up authoritative sources from Crossref, Google Books™, Open Library, and more using DOIs, ISBNs, URLs, or titles.
* Instant Formatting: Generate in-text citations (narrative or parenthetical) and full reference lists in APA, MLA, Chicago/Turabian, or Harvard styles with perfect precision.
* Your Private Reference Library: Store, tag, and pin your frequently used sources. All entries live securely in a hidden Google Drive™ folder that only you can access.
* Reliable Metadata: Automatically fetches and corrects publication details—authors, dates, titles, publishers—so you always cite accurate information.

## ✨ Core Formatting Features <a name="formatting-features"></a>
### Academic & Custom Style Presets <a name="academic-custom"></a>
* Standard Academic Styles: Instantly apply correctly structured APA, MLA, Harvard, and Chicago/Turabian presets—including margins, spacing, headers, and font rules.
* Create Your Own Presets: Capture any combination of your document’s formatting—fonts, colors, spacing, paragraph structure—and save it for one-click reuse.
* Share With Team or Class: Export and import presets to maintain consistent formatting across teams, departments, and classrooms.

### Smart Formatting Engine <a name="smart-formatting"></a>
* Targeted Styling: Apply formatting to the whole document or only selected sections.
* Content-Safe Design: EazyFormat protects your document’s structure—your tables, images, TOC, and intentional bold/italic text remain untouched.

## ✨ Productivity & Cleanup Tools <a name="productivity-cleanup"></a>
* Flexible Page Setup: Adjust page sizes (A3, Letter, Legal, custom book sizes) and page colors straight from the sidebar.
* Document Cleanup: Remove extra spaces and blank lines instantly to produce a clean, professional final draft.

## ✨ Who Benefits from EazyFormat <a name="benefits-eazyformat"></a>

* Teachers & Educators: Provide ready-made layouts and reduce student errors with easy-to-apply formatting rules.
* Students & Researchers: Switch between citation styles instantly and manage all references in one organized library.

## ✨ Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
